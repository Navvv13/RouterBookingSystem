# Bus Booking System
Created a web application that allows
users to view and book seats on a bus. The application will show the available and booked
seats, and allow users to book a seat by clicking on it. Payment integration is not required for
this application. The application will also have APIs that allow users to check the status of a seat
and book a seat, as well as an API for an administrator to release a particular seat. The web
application should be developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and
Node.js)


## Features

- Show available and booked seats: The application should display a visual representation
  of the seats on the bus, with booked seats highlighted or marked in some way to
  distinguish them from available seats.
- Seat status: Users should be able to check the status of a particular seat (i.e., whether it
  is available or booked) by clicking on it or by using an API. 


  
- Book seat: Users should be able to book a seat by clicking on it or by using an API.
  When a seat is booked, it should be marked as unavailable and the user should receive
  confirmation that their booking has been successful.
- Admin API to release a particular seat: An administrator should be able to use an API to
  release a seat that has been booked, making it available for other users to book.
- In addition to these functionalities, the application also includes that necessary user
  authentication and authorization features to ensure that only authorized users can access the
  APIs and book seats.
